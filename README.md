# Spring Boot Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository serves as my personal learning space for mastering Spring Boot. Here, I'm exploring various features, concepts, and best practices of the Spring Boot framework through hands-on coding. Each commit and branch represents a step in my journey to build robust and efficient Java applications.

## About This Repository

My goal with this repository is to:
* Solidify my understanding of core Spring Boot principles.
* Implement various Spring modules (e.g., Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Web).
* Practice building RESTful APIs.
* Learn and apply best practices for enterprise application development with Spring.
* Keep a chronological record of my learning progress.

Each major concept or feature I learn might be in a separate branch or a distinct commit within the `main` branch, depending on its scope. I aim to write clear commit messages to reflect my learning points.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** (Specify your Java version, e.g., Java 17)
* **Spring Boot:** (Specify your Spring Boot version, e.g., 3.3.0)
* **Maven/Gradle:** (Choose one and specify, e.g., Apache Maven 3.9.6)
